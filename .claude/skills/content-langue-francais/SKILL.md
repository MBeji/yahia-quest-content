description: >-
  Author French-language-learning content for the "francais" theme — courses,
  summaries, quizzes, and QCM exercises authored in French (immersion): grammaire,
  conjugaison, vocabulaire, orthographe, compréhension, fautes fréquentes, by CEFR
  level (A1–C2). Use whenever the user wants French-learning content / "améliore ton
  français" / French grammar, conjugation, or vocab exercises — e.g. "exercices de
  conjugaison au subjonctif", "quiz de vocabulaire français B1", "leçon sur l'accord
  du participe passé". Note: this is the standalone language track (theme francais),
  distinct from school French (content-ecole-tn). Defers to the content-engine skill
  (esp. references/language-track.md) for schema, quality bar, rewards, style, validation.

# content-langue-francais — French learning track

Authors content under the `francais` theme, `contentLanguage: "fr"`, `gradeSlug: null`. The content is
written **in French** (immersion). This is the standalone "améliore ton français" track — distinct
from the school program's French subject (use `content-ecole-tn` for that). The existing subject
`fr-mastery` already lives under this theme — extend it or add sibling subjects. The `francais` track
is a **free `libre` parcours** today; premium is decided per parcours, not by the legacy subject
`isPremium` flag. Read the content-engine skill and especially
`content-engine/references/language-track.md` before writing.

## Specifics

- **Theme/subjects**: `themeId: "francais"`, `contentLanguage: "fr"`, `gradeSlug: null`. Follow the
  two-axis model in `content-engine/references/language-track.md`: **one subject per CEFR level, the
  full A1→C2 ladder** — `francais-a1` (Débutant) … `francais-c2` (Maîtrise), six subjects sequenced by
  `displayOrder` — **plus one dedicated `francais-donjon`** subject (`01-donjon` opener + one
  `NN-gauntlet-{band}` chapter per level, `gauntlet-a2`…`gauntlet-c2`). **Mirror the shipped English
  track** (`content/anglais-*`) as the proven blueprint for shape, chapter mix and the rollout phases.
  The existing `fr-mastery` is a legacy single-subject perfecting module under this theme: keep it and
  complement it with the level subjects + donjon (it can be folded into the level model later — don't
  rename/delete its slugs without sign-off, as that re-keys its UUIDs). Leave `isPremium` off (free
  `libre` parcours; premium is per parcours).
- **Chapters**: one competence each, ordered simplest→most complex within the level (**~5–8 per
  level**). Beyond grammaire/conjugaison chapters, **every level ships a vocabulary chapter** (champ
  lexical, expressions idiomatiques, paronymes/faux-amis, formation des mots) **and a dedicated
  reading-comprehension chapter** (compréhension d'un court texte, montant en finesse avec la bande).
  cours.md teaches the rule with many example sentences and a conjugation/forms table; quiz.json (5 Q);
  exercises drill it via the ascending ladder (01-pratique → 02-revision → 03-boss → 04-defi →
  **05-drill**, the cumulative whole-chapter consolidation rung; see language-track.md).
- **Question types**: gap-fill, pick the correct form/agreement/conjugation, spot-the-error
  (use "find the error" prompts), choose the right meaning/synonym, identify the function.
- **Distractors = real interference errors** (homophone confusions like a/à, ses/ces, wrong
  agreement, wrong tense). Explanations name the rule and why distractors fail (≥25 chars).

## Sourcing

Hybrid: generate from model knowledge, verify usage/orthographe (e.g. against established references)
and CEFR alignment via web search, cite references in `chapter.json` `sources[]`.

## Then validate and stop

`npm run content:check` → `npm run content:qa:strict` → report (subject(s)/chapter(s), level, counts,
QA results, build/apply/PR steps). Don't build/apply or push unless asked.
