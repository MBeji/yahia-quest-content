# Math & notation standard — digits, equations, symbols (ALL languages, including Arabic)

This is a **hard rule**, not a style preference: numbers and mathematical/scientific notation are
**standard and international in every subject, whatever its `contentLanguage`** — identical in
Arabic, French, and English content. The production math subject (`content/math`, Arabic, 9ème) is
the precedent: Arabic prose around standard math. Never "arabize" the math itself.

## Digits — Western digits only, everywhere

- Always `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`. **Never Arabic-Indic digits** (`٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩`) — not in prompts,
  options, explanations, titles, cours.md, resume.md, or SVG figures. This applies to Arabic
  content too (math, sciences, but also dates and quantities in arabe/culture-générale).
- The QA tooling only _folds_ Arabic-Indic digits for comparison; it does not reject them — you
  enforce this rule at authoring time, and `content-audit` flags violations in existing content.

## Equations & expressions — standard international notation, LTR

- Formulas are written exactly as in a French/English textbook: Latin variable names (`x`, `y`,
  `a`, `b`), left-to-right, standard structure. E.g. in an Arabic prompt:
  `ما حلّ المعادلة: 2x + 5 = 13 ؟` — the Arabic question surrounds a standard equation.
- **Operators/symbols**: true minus `−` (U+2212, not the hyphen `-`), `×` for multiplication
  (never the letter x), `÷` or fraction bars, `=`, `≠`, `<`, `>`, `≤`, `≥`, `√`, `π`, `∈`, `⊂`,
  `⟺`, `→`. Exponents as `x²`, `10³` (Unicode superscripts).
- **Keep each formula a contiguous LTR run** inside RTL text: never interleave Arabic words
  _inside_ an equation; write the Arabic sentence, then the full expression, then resume Arabic
  (as the production math content does). In cours.md, put substantial formulas on their own line.
- **Arabic units in plain arithmetic are fine — don't fear them.** A quantity that repeats an
  Arabic-script unit across a linear chain (`10 مي + 2 مي + 2 مي = ؟`, `5 د + 200 مي`) renders
  **correctly natively**: digits and the linear operators (`+ − × ÷ = % °`) anchor as LTR runs, so
  the browser orders the whole line right. The renderer (`src/shared/lib/bidi.ts`) deliberately
  leaves these alone; isolating them would _break_ them. So write money/measure sums the natural
  way — no tricks needed.
- **Signed numbers TIGHT, binary operators SPACED — the one spacing rule that keeps negatives
  unambiguous.** A leading sign glued to its digit marks a _signed number_ (`−5`, `+90°`, `−2x`);
  spaces around a sign mark a _binary operation_ (`5 − 3`, `10 مي − 2 مي`, `0 د − 1`). The renderer
  keys on exactly this: it auto-isolates a **tight** signed number (`−5` → stays `−5`, never `5−`)
  but leaves spaced subtraction to the native algorithm. So **always write `x = −2`, `(−5)`,
  `مجموعة الحلول −3`, `الدوران +90°` tight**, and **always space a subtraction `12 − 5`**. Never
  write a signed number spaced (`− 5`) or a subtraction tight next to Arabic (`5د−1`) — both defeat
  the rule and can scramble. This is what fixed the concours-défi énoncés below.
- **Comparisons and abs-value in the énoncé: keep the whole relation a contiguous LTR run.** Write
  `|x − 3| < 4`, `−1 < x < 7`, `|−5| < |−2|` as one uninterrupted math run (no Arabic word inside),
  and the renderer isolates it so it reads left-to-right exactly as written — the inequality never
  flips and the bars never migrate. This is preferred over spelling the comparison in Arabic words;
  standard notation stays standard. The three reported ambiguous prompts, written correctly:
  - `كم عددًا صحيحًا يحقّق عدم المساواة |x − 3| < 4؟` — the abs-value inequality is one run.
  - `ما قيمة (2√3 − √5)(2√3 + √5)؟` — the difference-of-squares product is one run.
  - `بما أنّ −5 < −2، فإنّ |−5| < |−2|، إذن −5 أقرب إلى الصفر…` — every `−5`/`−2` is tight, so each
    signed number and each relation is isolated; none scrambles.
- **Never put Arabic script _inside_ a bidi-mirrored construct** — i.e. as the radicand of a
  radical or inside the brackets/relation it needs isolated. `√(المساحة)`, `√المساحة`, `(عدد ما)>0`
  fragment the LTR isolate and render scrambled. Write the operand as a **number or Latin symbol**
  (`√(S)`, `√32`), or say the root **in words**: `جذر المساحة` / `الجذر التربيعي للمساحة`, **not**
  `√(المساحة)`. The radical symbol `√` only ever takes a numeric/symbolic radicand.
- **Units & scientific symbols stay standard SI**: `cm`, `m²`, `kg`, `g/mol`, `%`, `°C`, `km/h` —
  never transliterated, in any language.

## No LaTeX anywhere — the app has no math renderer

The markdown renderer (`src/shared/lib/markdown.ts`) is a plain-text pipeline: it does **not**
render LaTeX. Any `\sqrt{…}`, `\frac{…}{…}`, `\overrightarrow{…}`, `\begin{pmatrix}`… displays as
raw markup to the student, and inline `$…$` shows its dollar signs literally. Therefore:

- **Everything is plain Unicode math** — cours.md, resume.md, question strings, SVG labels alike.
  `2x − 3 = 7`, `x ≥ −3`, `√(25 × 2) = 5√2`, `(xB − xA ; yB − yA)` all read fine as-is.
- **`$$ … $$` is allowed in cours.md only as a display-block marker** (the renderer turns it into
  a centered, LTR-isolated `lesson-math` block) — but its **content must be plain Unicode**, never
  LaTeX, and the **whole block must sit on a single line** (`$$ formula $$`): the renderer's regex
  doesn't span lines, so a multi-line block renders as literal `$$` paragraphs. One formula per
  block; stack several single-line blocks for a system of equations. Inline `$…$` is forbidden
  (not processed; dollars render).
- **Plain-Unicode equivalents** (match the production question conventions):
  `\sqrt{50}` → `√50`; `\sqrt{25 × 2}` → `√(25 × 2)` (parenthesize multi-term radicands);
  `\frac{a}{b}` → `a/b` with parentheses as needed (`(xA + xB)/2`); subscripts as plain letters
  (`xA`, `yB`); `\overrightarrow{AB}` → bare `AB` with the word for "vector" in prose
  (e.g. `الشعاع AB`); `\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}` → `(x ; y)`; `\boxed{X}` → `**X**`;
  `\times` → `×`; `\le`/`\ge` → `≤`/`≥`; `\parallel` → `∥`; `\implies` → `⟹`; `\iff` → `⟺`;
  `\sin`/`\cos`/`\tan` → `sin`/`cos`/`tan`; `x^2` → `x²`.
- **SVG figures**: numbers and labels inside `<text>` use Western digits and standard symbols.

## Decimal separator & locale details

- `fr` and `ar` content: decimal **comma** (`3,5`) — the Tunisian school convention. `en` content:
  decimal **point** (`3.5`).
- **Thousands separator — bidi-critical in Arabic.** In `ar` content, group digits with a
  **NO-BREAK SPACE U+00A0** (`38 461`), **never a plain space**: in RTL text a plain space is
  bidi-neutral, so `38 461` renders as `461 38` (the groups swap) even though the source is
  correct. U+00A0 has bidi class CS (common number separator), which keeps the whole number a
  single LTR run. In `fr` (LTR) a plain or no-break space both render fine — prefer U+00A0 for
  consistency; in `en` use the comma (`12,500`).
- Intervals, set notation, function notation follow the official textbook convention of the
  subject's grade (e.g. `]−2 ; +∞[`); keep the notation itself standard/LTR even in Arabic prose.
- **`< > ≤ ≥` next to Arabic look broken and are NOT — do not "fix" them.** In RTL, `2 > 1` is drawn
  `1 < 2`: Unicode mirrors the operator (rule L4) _and_ swaps the operands, which composes back to
  the same true statement, phrased the other way round. Reading the glyph left-to-right while
  reading the digits right-to-left is what makes it look reversed — that is a reading error, not a
  rendering one. This has raised a false alarm before (2026-07-16: ~740 correct items were nearly
  "corrected"), so it is deliberately **not** flagged by `content:qa` and a test guards that.
  Digits, by contrast, are not mirrorable — which is exactly why the split-number rule above is
  real. If you want an expression to render verbatim as authored, give it its own LTR-isolated
  `<text>` node (no Arabic inside); that is a fidelity choice, not a correctness fix.
- **List/set/interval/tuple separator — bidi-critical, NEVER the Arabic comma `،` (U+060C).**
  Inside a bracketed math group — a set `{−4 ; 4}`, an interval `]−1 ; 4[`, a tuple `(3 ; 4 ; 5)`,
  coordinates `(x ; y)` — separate items with a **semicolon `;`** (preferred — unambiguous next to
  the decimal comma) or a Latin comma `,`. The Arabic comma `،` is an Arabic-script character, so in
  RTL it breaks the expression's LTR run and the renderer scrambles it (`{−4 ، 4}` → `4}،{−4`,
  `]−1 ، 4[` → `4[،]−1`). This applies in **every** subject's `ar` content (math, sciences,
  physics value lists like `(f = 20 cm ; OA = −30 cm)`). `content:qa` fails strict on an Arabic
  comma found inside a math bracket group. (An Arabic comma in ordinary prose is fine — the rule is
  only about comma-separated **notation** inside brackets.)
- Worked computations in explanations chain standard notation with `→` and end with the
  verification check: `2x = 8 → x = 4. تحقّق: 2(4) + 5 = 13 ✓`.

## Self-check before running QA

Scan every file you wrote for `[٠-٩]` (must be zero matches), for hyphens used as minus signs in
formulas, for the letter `x` used as a multiplication sign, for **LaTeX residue** (regex
`\\[a-zA-Z]+` — zero matches in any content file) and **inline dollar math** (`$…$` outside
`$$ … $$` display blocks — zero matches), and — **in `ar` content** — for a plain space between
digit groups (regex `\d \d{3}` outside `<svg>` markup, must be zero: use U+00A0), for an
**Arabic radicand** (regex `[√∛∜](?:[؀-ۿ]|\([^)]*[؀-ۿ])` — must be zero: rewrite as a
number/symbol or the root in words), and for the **Arabic comma `،` (U+060C) inside a math bracket
group** (a set/interval/tuple separator — must be zero: use `;`), and for a **spaced signed
number** in `ar` prose (a sign flanked by spaces where a _signed number_ is meant, `= − 5` /
`إذن − 5`, rather than a subtraction — write it tight `−5`). The `content-audit` skill performs the
same scans on existing content, and `content:qa` fails strict on the Arabic-radicand, the
Arabic-comma-in-math **and** the **split-number** patterns — the last one added 2026-07-16
(`auditRtlNotation`), after a `::: figure` caption shipped with a plain space and rendered
«العدد 758 3». The scan below is no longer the only net under this rule.

**Two recurring U+00A0 traps** (seen authoring multi-digit Arabic content):

1. **The file-write path can silently flatten U+00A0 → a plain space.** So re-run the `\d \d{3}` scan
   _after_ writing each file and re-inject U+00A0 (e.g. a byte-level rewrite) wherever a plain space
   reappeared — otherwise the bidi swap ships.
2. **Group consistently across option, prompt and explanation.** An _option_ left ungrouped (`308000`)
   while its prompt/explanation is grouped (`308 000`) trips `content:qa`'s «answer value not echoed»
   warning — that check's number-extractor splits on the U+00A0, so the two forms no longer match.
   Group (or leave ungrouped) the **same way** everywhere in a question.
