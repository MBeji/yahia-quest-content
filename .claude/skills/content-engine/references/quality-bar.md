# Quality bar — what makes content pass and what makes it good

Two layers gate content. Layer 1 (Zod) is a hard fail — invalid content never compiles. Layer 2
(`content:qa`) catches answer-key defects. Beyond both, there is a pedagogical bar that no tool can
enforce but that defines the product's value — hold yourself to it.

## Layer 1 — structural (Zod, always hard-fails, run via `content:check`)

- Quiz 3–10 questions; exercise 1–50 questions; options 2–6 per question.
- Option **ids unique**; `correctOption` must equal one of the option ids.
- Difficulty: question 1–3, exercise 1–4. `xpReward` > 0; `rewardCoins` ≥ 0; `displayOrder` > 0.
- Subject `id`/`themeId` kebab-case; `contentLanguage` ∈ {ar,fr,en}.

## Layer 2 — answer-key heuristics (`content:qa` / `content:qa:strict`)

`content:qa` is advisory (always exits 0). `content:qa:strict` exits 1 only on **errors**. There is
exactly one error-level check; the rest are warnings. Fix all errors; fix warnings unless there's a
real reason not to.

1. **[ERROR] Duplicate option texts** — two options with the same text (after folding Arabic-Indic
   digits and stripping whitespace). This is the only check that fails `--strict`. Every option must
   be textually distinct.
2. **[warn] Answer value not echoed** — for a _short, non-Arabic, numeric_ correct answer (≤24 chars),
   the number(s) must also appear in the explanation. Always restate the computed answer in the
   explanation.
3. **[warn] Thin explanation** — explanation `< 25` characters. Write explanations of at least a full
   sentence; aim well past 25 chars.
4. **[warn] Explanation contradicts the key** — the explanation names a _different_ option (a–f) as
   correct, or calls the _correct_ option wrong. Keep the explanation consistent with `correctOption`.
   (Exempt for "find the error / intruder / odd-one-out" prompts, where the correct answer is itself
   the wrong item.)

Note: there is **no** automated check for duplicate _questions_, banned content, answer-position
balance, or difficulty distribution — you own those by judgment (below).

## Layer 3 — the pedagogical bar (judgment; this is the real value)

- **Every distractor encodes a specific, named misconception** — a sign error, a confused rule, a
  classic trap. No filler/obviously-absurd options. The wrong answers should be tempting to a student
  who half-understands.
- **Explanations teach.** State the rule, apply it to this item (show the computation with a `✓`
  check on harder questions), and on boss/challenge items name the common trap ("الخطأ الشائع…" /
  "le piège courant…") explaining why the plausible wrong answer fails.
- **Difficulty ramps within an exercise** (start at 1, end near the exercise's tier ceiling) and the
  quiz skews easy (difficulty 1–2) since it only gates comprehension.
- **Age- and grade-appropriate presentation.** Beyond _being on syllabus_ (scope) and _being tagged at
  the right difficulty_ (ramp), every item must _read_ as written for the learner's developmental stage:
  vocabulary, sentence length, the real-world contexts/scenarios it leans on, the magnitude of the
  numbers, and the cognitive load (steps to hold in mind) all fit the audience. The audience is the
  **school grade** — primary `1ère…6ème année de base` ≈ 6–12 yo, collège `7ème…9ème` ≈ 12–15, secondary
  through `Bac` ≈ 15–18 — or, for non-school themes, the **declared level** (CEFR band for languages,
  the difficulty tier elsewhere). A 1ère/2ème-année prompt uses short sentences, small numbers, and
  concrete familiar contexts (animals, toys, the classroom, sharing sweets); a Bac or C1 prompt may be
  dense and abstract. Defects even when the notion is on-syllabus: vocabulary above the grade, adult or
  irrelevant scenarios for young children (taxes, mortgages, workplace), numbers/abstraction past the
  grade's range, a childish or condescending register for teens, or any mature/unsafe theme for the age.
- **Balance the answer key** — spread `correctOption` across a/b/c/d as a tidiness habit, but know it
  is cosmetic: the engine **shuffles option order at display** (per-attempt Fisher-Yates), so the key
  letter is never player-visible. The leak that survives shuffling is **content-based** — never let the
  correct option be recognisable as the longest, most-detailed, or only-one-with-a-justification answer
  (see "Homogeneous options" below). That is the rule that actually matters.
- **No duplicate or near-duplicate questions** within or across a chapter's exercises.
- **Respect the anti-rush floor**: an attempt under `4s × question count` earns nothing and doesn't
  satisfy the gate, so keep enough questions (quiz 5, exercise 6) that a genuine attempt clears it.
- **Factual accuracy**: verify non-trivial facts via web search and cite them in `chapter.json`
  `sources[]`. For the school program, fidelity to the official syllabus overrides everything
  (see content-ecole-tn).
- **Language purity**: write entirely in the subject's `contentLanguage`. The only non-content-language
  tokens allowed are math/LaTeX symbols, folder slugs, `mode` values, and source URLs.
- **Standard notation everywhere**: Western digits (0–9) and standard LTR equations/units in **all**
  languages — Arabic content never uses Arabic-Indic digits or arabized formulas. Hard rule; see
  `math-and-notation.md`.

## Question craft — what an irreproachable QCM item looks like

Beyond the distractor/explanation rules above, every item must pass these craft checks:

- **One stem, one task, one defensible answer.** The prompt asks exactly one thing and is
  self-contained (solvable without seeing the options first, for computation items). If two options
  could be argued correct, rewrite the item.
- **Clear, minimal cognitive load.** The stem reads cleanly on the first pass: as short as the task
  allows, one sentence where possible, no nested clauses or back-references that force re-reading, no
  irrelevant data that doesn't bear on the answer, no undefined symbol/abbreviation. The reader spends
  their effort on the _notion being tested_, not on decoding the wording. A prompt that is correct and
  on-syllabus but convoluted, padded, or ambiguous-until-you-see-the-options still fails this check —
  simplify the phrasing or split the task.
- **Linguistically well-formed and idiomatic.** Every prompt and option must read as natural,
  grammatically correct prose in the content language — read each one aloud; if a native speaker
  would stumble, rewrite it. In Arabic in particular: correct agreement, and **dual pronouns
  (`هما`, `بينهما`, `كلاهما`) only when there are exactly two referents** — never a dangling dual
  over an enumerated set of three or more. The question clause must parse unambiguously on first
  read, with a clear referent. ✗ `ثلاثة أعمدة … أيّها بينهما في الطول؟` (dual `هما` over three
  columns — incoherent) → ✓ `… أيّها ليس الأقصر ولا الأطول؟`. Avoid calque/translationese
  constructions (e.g. the bare `لا واحد` for "none" — write idiomatic `لا شيء` / `ولا واحد منها`,
  or better, a real distractor).
- **No meta-options.** Never options that reference the _other options_ — "all of the above",
  "none of the above" / "aucune de ces réponses" / "لا شيء ممّا سبق", "a and b", "I don't know".
  Four real, independent candidate answers. (A substantive "nothing / zero / none-of-the-world"
  answer — `لا شيء` meaning _nothing happens_, `0`, `aucun jour` — is a legitimate real answer, not
  a meta-option; the ban is only on options that defer to the answer list itself.)
- **Negative stems are rare and bolded.** Prefer positive phrasing; if you must ask "which is
  **not**…", bold/emphasize the negation so it cannot be skimmed past (and remember such prompts
  exempt the contradiction check — don't overuse them).
- **Homogeneous options.** Same grammatical form, same order of magnitude of length and detail.
  The correct answer must not be recognizable as the longest, most precise, or most hedged option.
- **Deterministic option order.** Sort numeric options ascending (or descending — consistently);
  order text options logically (chronological, alphabetical, or by length). Randomizing the _key_
  is the engine's job via your key balance — the _display_ order should look deliberate.
- **No option leaks.** An option must not be contradicted or confirmed by the wording of the stem
  or of another option; distractors must not overlap (two options that mean the same thing).
- **Difficulty tag is honest.** A d1 question is answerable by a student who just read the course;
  a d3 question requires combining ≥2 notions or a multi-step computation. Don't tag for ordering
  convenience.
- **Illustrate what the question is ABOUT — a spatial/visual item without a figure is a defect.**
  This is the question-side of `course-quality.md` Axis 5. If the item is about a **shape, an angle,
  a triangle, a circle, a solid, a coordinate/vector plane, a graph to read, a scientific diagram, a
  figure/table to interpret**, it carries an inline `<svg>` — reading the figure is the skill, and
  the words-only version forces the pupil to build the picture in their head before they can even
  start. Full doctrine (families, drawing rules, per-cycle vertex naming, colour for young grades):
  **`course-figures.md`** (one shared doctrine for courses and questions). Three hard rules:
  - **Only where it SERVES (never decoration).** A pure computation — «calculer lim x→2 (3x²−5)»,
    «3/4 + 1/2» — gets **no** figure: a graph there is noise, or it hands over the answer (the
    horizontal asymptote _is_ the limit). Illustrate the _visual_ items, not every item.
  - **The figure must be TRUE.** Points announced on a segment are on it, parallels are parallel, a
    right angle is 90°, a plotted curve passes through the stated values. A figure that contradicts
    its statement makes a correct question **unanswerable** — worse than no figure. Re-derive the
    coordinates; double-solve the item _on the figure_.
  - **The figure must not LEAK the key.** A question figure shows the _scene_, never the answer: no
    answer-word label, no marked correct option. A figure may live in the **options** (visual QCM:
    "which piece completes the pattern?") — then all four options carry a comparable figure, none
    marked. And for a "how many solutions" item, draw the _forced_ crossings, not one that quietly
    argues for the wrong count (a single crossing under a "unique solution is false" stem is a trap).
  - **Young grades (≈ 1ère–3ème, 6–8 ans) — illustrate almost everything**, colourfully and
    concretely (a bird above a tree, a ball in a box), because a 6-year-old barely reads. This is the
    HIGHEST illustration priority in the catalogue, not the lowest.

## Self-verification protocol — run it BEFORE `content:check`/`content:qa`

The automated layers catch structure, not correctness. Before running the checks, do a **blind
verification pass** over every file you wrote:

1. **Re-solve every question yourself, without looking at `correctOption`**, then compare. Any
   mismatch = fix the item (don't just flip the key — understand which was wrong).
2. **Re-read each explanation against the key**: it must assert the keyed option and only that one,
   restate the computed value (numeric answers), and not accidentally validate a distractor.
3. **Tally the answer key** across each exercise and across the chapter: no letter > ~40% of items,
   every letter used at least once per exercise where possible.
4. **Scan for duplicates / near-duplicates** (same fact or computation re-asked with cosmetic
   changes) within and across the chapter's exercises and quiz.
5. **Scan notation**: zero Arabic-Indic digits, true minus `−` in formulas, standard units, and —
   in `ar` content — **no plain space inside grouped numbers** (`\d \d{3}` outside `<svg>` must be
   zero; use U+00A0, else the bidi algorithm swaps the groups at render time — see
   `math-and-notation.md`).
6. **Check the ramp**: per-question difficulty is non-decreasing within each exercise and matches
   the exercise tier; the quiz stays at d1–2.
7. **Figure sweep** (§ Question craft, "Illustrate what the question is about"): list every item
   whose notion is spatial/visual (shape, angle, solid, repère/vecteur, graph-reading, diagram,
   figure/table to interpret) — each must carry an `<svg>`, or you note why a figure would not
   serve. For every figure present, **double-solve the item on the figure** (it must be TRUE and
   must not leak the key). For a young-grade (1ère–3ème) file, expect a figure on nearly every item.

Only after this pass run `content:check` and `content:qa:strict`. To audit _existing_ content with
the same rigor, use the **`content-audit`** skill.

## Non-academic content — every correction is a mini-lesson

For **non-school programs** (culture-générale, muscle-cerveau, language tracks), the explanation is a
**mini-lesson, not a verdict**. Whether the student answered right or wrong, the correction must leave
them knowing more than before:

- State the correct answer and **why** it is correct.
- **Add 1–2 extra facts / context** around it — for culture-générale a date, a cause, a related
  figure, a "le savais-tu ?"; for languages the rule plus a clean example; for brain-training the
  method and why it works.
- Briefly say why the tempting wrong option is wrong (the misconception), so a wrong answer still teaches.

The goal: even a missed question grows the user's general culture and is memorable. Keep it concise
(2–4 sentences), accurate (verify facts via web, cite in `chapter.json` `sources[]`), and never
contradict the key. This is on top of the ≥25-char / no-duplicate-options rules above.
